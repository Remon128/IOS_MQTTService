-I wanted to build an application that uses MQTT Remote service to susbcribe to it, and publish messages on that Device
-I started with Setting Client Configuration
-Established Connection to Broke that host myDevice
-Subscribed to myDevice
-Started to publihs Messages on myDevice Screen.

-I have learned good basics about MQTT services for remote control.

-I have developed This App on Swift because:
    -Swift is faster than Objective-c
    -Much simpiler.
    -Contains closures.
    -Less files, No much Headers files like Objec-C
    -Contains Optionals which makes development more dynamically
    -Support Tuples
    -Easier String Concatanation.
